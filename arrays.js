nums.push();
//the output of "nums.push()" will add to the end of my array.

//the output of "boolean.shift()" will remove the first element from the array,
//then returns the removed element

// Index positions are the number corilated to an element in an array.
// these Index positions start and 0 and can go on for how many ever elements are in an array
// For example, "Hello" in var words is 0
// and, "51" in var nums is 1
//lastly, "false" is in both 2 and 3
